Help anglers make safe and legal choices when fishing for trout.


Yu need `npm` installed to run this puppy.
```
$ npm --version
5.2.0
```

after that...
```
npm install
```

Now all the code should be ready to run now.
Run a local copy of it with:
```
npm run serve
```

now you should be able to see it by opening up your browser to `localhost:7766`
