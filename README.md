# Running 2017 version

You need `npm` installed to run this puppy.
https://nodejs.org/

Once you download node, ensure that it's properly installed on your system by opening a terminal and typing this:
```
$ npm --version
5.2.0
```

after that...
```
npm install
```

Now all the code should be ready to run now.
Run a local copy of it with:
```
npm run serve
```

now you should be able to see it by opening up your browser to `localhost:7766`

# Running super secret 2018 version
Some basic things you need:
- git version control system to download the code. I recommend either https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/ or https://desktop.github.com/ if you're unfamiliar with git.
- `node`, `npm`, and `yarn` so you can run the code on a local server. Get node and npm here: https://nodejs.org/en/ - yarn is available here https://yarnpkg.com
- download the latest version of this code through git and point your terminal to the root directory where the README.md file is.
- run `git status` to make sure everything went through fine.
- run `yarn --version` to make sure you have yarn installed
- run `npm --version` to make sure you have yarn installed
- if everything is installed correctly, those three commands will work just fine
- now, to install all the 3rd party code that I didn't feel like writting, run `yarn` in the terminal.
- after they install, you should be able to `yarn start` and see the thing start up on `localhost:3000`.

Good luck!
